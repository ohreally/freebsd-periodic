# Show temperature for those components that support it.

# To retrieve HDD temperature, this script needs the
# sysutils/smartmontools package to be in—ïtalled.
# Without this package installed, this script will only display
# CPU and ACPI temperature.

# Installation:
# - Copy this script to /usr/local/etc/periodic/daily/436.status-temperature
# - Make it executable

# The execution of this script is disabled per default.
# To enable, set the following in /etc/periodic.conf:
#
#   daily_status_temperature_enable="YES"

# To learn more about `periodic', see periodic(8) and periodic.conf(5).
